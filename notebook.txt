10/12/2021 10:15 - JBW created HPC directory, sub-directories, & this log file
10/12/2021 11:30 - JBW merged HPC directories with github repo (after much struggle)
10/13/2021 14:00 - JBW met with Carolyn, got draft genome onto poseidon & discussed how to load sequences
10/13/2021 17:00 - JBW submitted poseidon job to retrieve sequences >> got morning email on 10/14 that job failed. Looks like 1 seq was huge
10/14/2021 15:00 - JBW submitted poseidon job to retrieve remaining samples & (for space) deleted the 1 140G sequence
			NOTE: Also omitted 1 other large sample (SRR7235995, with >300 million reads)
10/14/2021 17:30 - JBW noticed 3 seqs were missing (besides the 2 big ones omitted on purpose); submitted job to poseidon to retrieve them
10/15/2021 12:45 - JBW: One sequence (SRR12363325) returns the following error: "fasterq-dump.2.10.0 fatal: SIGNAL - Segmentation fault" ??
10/16/2021 11:30 - JBW talked with Carolyn re: missing sequence, & turns out the seqs are too big...
			As instructed, sbatch job was submitted to gzip all the files (raw_data/sra/zip.txt)
10/17/2021 10:50 - JBW: One sequence was in the folder twice (somehow), but all others were successfully gzipped and the duplicate was deleted
			Will now try to pull final missing sequence.
10/17/2021 12:50 - JBW: Missing sequence has been loaded & gzipped ! All data (besides the 2 huge sequence files) is loaded!
			NOTE: The sequence files contain N's in addition to ATCG's; the N's signify an ambiguous base
10/19/2021 9:00 - EF created project Jupyter notebook & directory
10/19/2021 14:15 - JBW removed 2 accession numbers from seq_access_nums.txt :: the 2 biggest in size
10/22/2021 16:30 - Group loaded cutadapt (v2.6, bc 1.6 was unavailable) & ran sbatch to trim seqs
			NOTE: Smallest seq (SRR7235991) returned errors with cutadapt test > sequence was likely not loaded fully. Delete & re-load!
10/25/2021 8:00  - EF wrote python script to pull trim stats from log
10/25/2021 12:00 - Group meeting: re-loaded & zipped smallest seq,
			CLR started alignment script, 
10/27/2021 14:00 - CLR ran bwa_index.txt prior to alignment b/c this said to: https://github.com/jts/methylation-analysis/issues/13
		       ran practice alignment script (practice_align.txt)
10/27/2021 14:45 - CLR submitted poseidon job to align all trimmed sequences with align_seqs.txt
10/28/2021 12:00 - CLR ran samtools on aligned sequences
10/29/2021 12:00 - CLR ran additional samtools processing on aligned sequences
11/11/2021 8:00  - EF drafted batch scripts for calling snps
11/11/2021 14:00 - Group meeting: updated github, started running mpileup
11/11/2021 18:00 - CLR ran bcftools call function
11/11/2021 19:00 - EF ran bcftools view
			NOTE: error when loading shared libraries; updated bcftools and was able to run succesfully
11/12/2021 7:00  - EF submitted batch script for bcftools filter and installed vcftools
			NOTE: vcftools version 0.1.13 (used in original github) is ntot available on bioconda; installed 0.1.14
11/12/2021 14:00 - JBW and EF met with Cory to resolve github push issues
11/12/2021 15:00 = EF ran vcftools to filter out low-quality SNPs
11/17/2021 13:00 - Group met w/ Carolyn & confirmed that .vcf output looked OK; JBW & EF tested out R code, confirmed that plots looked OK
11/18/2021 10:00 - CLR ran PCADAPT (v. 4.3.3) for outlier detection on local device (will add files to HPC after comparing to Bayescan)
		   CLR created Bayescan environment
			NOTE: Bayescan version 2.0.1 used (2.1.0 not available in conda)	
11/18/2021 11:00 - JBW created and uploaded csv files of Supplemental Table 1: (i) the full table, and (ii) the table, subset with only the 47 sequences we re-analyzed
			NOTE: If reading full table into R, must specify na.strings = c("n.a.","") because authors had both n.a.'s and blank cells
11/28/2021 13:30 - JBW moved the supp_table files and the .txt file explaining how the supp table was re-ordered to match the .vcf file into the output folder;
			JBW also uploaded the re-made Fig 2 & the .Rmd script used to make it!
12/01/2021 13:30 - JBW moved lots of things from data/ to output/ following project instructions (sorry if this throws anyone off!!)
12/02/2021 15:45 - JBW updated .gitignore file
