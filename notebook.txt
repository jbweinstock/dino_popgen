10/12/2021 10:15 - JBW created HPC directory, sub-directories, & this log file
10/12/2021 11:30 - JBW merged HPC directories with github repo (after much struggle)
10/13/2021 14:00 - JBW met with Carolyn, got draft genome onto poseidon & discussed how to load sequences
10/13/2021 17:00 - JBW submitted poseidon job to retrieve sequences >> got morning email on 10/14 that job failed. Looks like 1 seq was huge
10/14/2021 15:00 - JBW submitted poseidon job to retrieve remaining samples & (for space) deleted the 1 140G sequence
			NOTE: Also omitted 1 other large sample (SRR7235995, with >300 million reads)
10/14/2021 17:30 - JBW noticed 3 seqs were missing (besides the 2 big ones omitted on purpose); submitted job to poseidon to retrieve them
10/15/2021 12:45 - JBW: One sequence (SRR12363325) returns the following error: "fasterq-dump.2.10.0 fatal: SIGNAL - Segmentation fault" ??
10/16/2021 11:30 - JBW talked with Carolyn re: missing sequence, & turns out the seqs are too big...
			As instructed, sbatch job was submitted to gzip all the files (raw_data/sra/zip.txt)
10/17/2021 10:50 - JBW: One sequence was in the folder twice (somehow), but all others were successfully gzipped and the duplicate was deleted
			Will now try to pull final missing sequence.
10/17/2021 12:50 - JBW: Missing sequence has been loaded & gzipped ! All data (besides the 2 huge sequence files) is loaded!
			NOTE: The sequence files contain N's in addition to ATCG's; the N's signify an ambiguous base
10/19/2021 9:00 - EF created project Jupyter notebook & directory
10/19/2021 14:15 - JBW removed 2 accession numbers from seq_access_nums.txt :: the 2 biggest in size
10/22/2021 16:30 - Group loaded cutadapt (v2.6, bc 1.6 was unavailable) & ran sbatch to trim seqs
			NOTE: Smallest seq (SRR7235991) returned errors with cutadapt test > sequence was likely not loaded fully. Delete & re-load!
10/25/2021 12:00 - Group meeting: re-loaded & zipped smallest seq,
			Caroline started alignment script, 
			Evie created script for summary stats on trims
10/27/2021 14:00 - CLR ran bwa_index.txt prior to alignment b/c this said to: https://github.com/jts/methylation-analysis/issues/13
		       ran practice alignment script (practice_align.txt)
10/27/2021 14:45 - CLR submitted poseidon job to align all trimmed sequences with align_seqs.txt
